The first thing I did was change the content of the page.
I read through MDN elements refrence and was able to change the namr of the website when you see it in your tabs.
The next thing I learned about was inserting images using  tag.
Next I googled how to align images in a row and implemented that onto the html file as well as the css file. 
I was also able to to embed links into the titles of the images.
I noticed that the text of the website was red so I went into the css file and changed the text to black.
